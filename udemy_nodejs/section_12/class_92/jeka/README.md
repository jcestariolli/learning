# :star: Creating an application fron zero
Through this class we created an application from zero.

<br/>

The idea is to build an application to deal with todos.

## Creating the application structure
So, first, we create the directories structure for NodeJS:
```
npm init 
```

<br/>

Then we install all dependencies to build an webserver:
```
npm install --save-dev express ejs body-parser mongoose

```
